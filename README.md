# OpenStack TripleO/Director HA Test Suite
This project is a modular and a customizable test suite to be applied in an Overcloud OpenStack environment deployed via TripleO upstream or Red Hat OpenStack Director (OSPd).

## Usage
The script needs at least a test file (-t) which must contain the sequence of the operations to be done.
A recovery file (-r), with the sequence of the operations needed to recovery the environment can also be passed.
So a typical invocation will be something like this:

    [heat-admin@overcloud-controller-0 overcloud-ha-test-suite]$ ./overcloud-ha-test-suite.sh -t test/test_keystone-constraint-removal -r recovery/recovery_keystone-constraint-removal 
    Fri May 20 15:27:19 UTC 2016 - Populationg overcloud elements...OK
    Fri May 20 15:27:22 UTC 2016 - Test: Stop keystone resource (by stopping httpd), check no other resource  is stopped
    Fri May 20 15:27:22 UTC 2016 * Step 1: disable keystone resource via httpd stop
    Fri May 20 15:27:22 UTC 2016 - Performing action disable on resource httpd ..OK
    Fri May 20 15:27:26 UTC 2016 - List of cluster's failed actions:
    Cluster is OK.
    Fri May 20 15:27:29 UTC 2016 * Step 2: check resource status
    Fri May 20 15:27:29 UTC 2016 - Cycling for 10 minutes polling every minute the status of the resources
    Fri May 20 15:28:29 UTC 2016 - Polling...
    delay -> OK
    galera -> OK
    ...
    ...
    openstack-sahara-engine -> OK
    rabbitmq -> OK
    redis -> OK
    Fri May 20 15:41:00 UTC 2016 - List of cluster's failed actions:
    Cluster is OK.
    Fri May 20 15:41:03 UTC 2016 - Waiting 10 seconds to recover environment
    Fri May 20 15:41:13 UTC 2016 - Recovery: Enable keystone via httpd and check for failed actions
    Fri May 20 15:41:13 UTC 2016 * Step 1: enable keystone resource via httpd
    Fri May 20 15:41:13 UTC 2016 - Performing action enable on resource httpd-clone OK
    Fri May 20 15:41:15 UTC 2016 - List of cluster's failed actions:
    Cluster is OK.
    Fri May 20 15:41:17 UTC 2016 - End

The exit status will depend on the result of the operations. If a disable operation fails, if failed actions will appear, if recovery does not ends with success exit status will not be 0.

## Test and recoveries
Test and recovery are bash script portions that are included inside the main script. Some functions and variables are available to help on recurring operations.
These functions are listed here:

- **check_failed_actions**: will print failed actions and return error in case some of them are present;
- **check_resources_process_status**: will check for the process status of the resources on the system (not in the cluster), i.e. will check if there is a process for mysql daemon;
- **wait_resource_status**: will wail until a default timeout ($RESOURCE_CHANGE_STATUS_TIMEOUT) for a resource to reach a status;
- **check_resource_status**: will check a resource status, i.e. if you want to check if httpd resource is started;
- **wait_cluster_start**: will wait the until a timeout ($RESOURCE_CHANGE_STATUS_TIMEOUT) to be started, specifically will wait for all resources to be in state "Started";
- **play_on_resources**: will set the status of a resource;

The variables are:

- **OVERCLOUD_CORE_RESOURCES**: which are galera and rabbitmq
- **OVERCLOUD_RESOURCES**: which are *all* the resources
- **OVERCLOUD_SYSTEMD_RESOURCES**: which are the resources managed via systemd by pacemaker;

And can be used in combination to wrote test and recovery files.

### Test file contents
A typical test file, say test/test_keystone-constraint-removal, will contain something like this:

    # Test: Stop keystone resource (by stopping httpd), check no other resource is stopped
    
    echo "$(date) * Step 1: disable keystone resource via httpd stop"
    play_on_resources "disable" "httpd"
       
    echo "$(date) - List of cluster's failed actions:"
    check_failed_actions
    
    echo "$(date) * Step 2: check resource status"
    # Define resource list without httpd
    OVERCLOUD_RESOURCES_NO_KEYSTONE="$(echo $OVERCLOUD_RESOURCES | sed 's/httpd/ /g')"
    # Define number of minutes to look for status
    MINUTES=10
    # Cycling for $MINUTES minutes polling every minute the status of the resources
    echo "$(date) - Cycling for 10 minutes polling every minute the status of the resources"
    i=0
    while [ $i -lt $MINUTES ]
     do
      # Wait a minute
      sleep 60
      echo "$(date) - Polling..."
      for resource in $OVERCLOUD_RESOURCES_NO_KEYSTONE
       do
        echo -n "$resource -> "
        check_resource_status "$resource" "Started"
        [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "OK" || (FAILURES=1; echo "Error!")
       done
      let "i++"
     done
    
    echo "$(date) - List of cluster's failed actions:"
    check_failed_actions

Code is commented and should be self explaining, but in short:
- the first commented line, after "# Test: " is read as test title;
- using play_on_resources it disables httpd resource;
- it checks for failed actions;
- it defines a list of variable named OVERCLOUD_RESOURCES_NO_KEYSTONE containing all the variable but httpd;
- it cycles for 10 minutes, polling every minute the status of all the resources;

If any of these steps for some reason fails, then the overall test will be considered failed and the exit status will not be 0.

### Recovery file contents
A typical recovery file, say recovery/recovery_keystone-constraint-removal, will contain something like this:

    # Recovery: Enable keystone via httpd and check for failed actions
    
    echo "$(date) * Step 1: enable keystone resource via httpd"
    play_on_resources "enable" "httpd-clone"
    
    echo "$(date) - List of cluster's failed actions:"
    check_failed_actions

Again:
- the first commented line, after "# Recovery: " is read as recovery title;
- using play_on_resources it enables httpd resource;
- it checks for failed actions;
